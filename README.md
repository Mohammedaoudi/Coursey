# AR-FirstAid - README

## Overview
This application is a robust learning platform designed to provide training in various fields, including First Aid and Anatomy. The platform includes Android and web clients, enabling participants to enroll in courses, take quizzes, and earn certifications upon successful completion. Advanced features include Augmented Reality (AR) modules for interactive learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to provide feedback on CPR training using video analysis. 

The platform is built on a microservices architecture and follows modern development and deployment practices, such as CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and observability.

### Global Architecture
The system consists of three main components:
- **Web Client**: A React-based frontend for both participants and administrators.
- **Mobile Client**: A native Android application tailored for participants.
- **Backend Services**: Microservices architecture to manage core functionalities like training content, quizzes, and certifications.

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, testing, and deployment processes:
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. Jenkins triggers the build process.
3. Maven builds the project and runs unit tests.
4. SonarQube performs code analysis and quality checks.
5. Docker images are built and pushed to the Docker registry.
6. The application is deployed to test and production environments.

## Docker Configuration

### Docker Compose Configuration
The platform uses Docker Compose to manage its services:
- **Keycloak**: Authentication and user management.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user data and training information.
- **Backend Microservices**: Handle course content, authentication, and notifications.
- **Observability Stack**: Includes Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo.

A sample `docker-compose.yml` file is included for local setup.

### Deployment Commands

#### Development
```bash
# Local development deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up -d
```

#### Testing
```bash
# Test environment deployment
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml app_stack
```

#### Production
```bash
# Production deployment
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml app_stack
```

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Build Monitoring**: Jenkins pipelines track build status.
- **Code Quality Metrics**: SonarQube for static analysis and quality gates.
- **Container Logs**: Managed via Loki and visualized in Grafana.
- **Application-Level Logs**: Managed via Tempo.

## Security Considerations

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensures secure communication.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secures API endpoints.
- **Docker Best Practices**: Minimizes vulnerabilities.
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolates test and production environments.
